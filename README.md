# Sparse-Matrix-Multiplication

This is a C++ program that implements sparse matrix using a Linked List and multiplies them.
The program has been designed to take two sparse matrices as input and print the product of the two matrices.

This project has been done under the guidance of Dr. A.K. Bhateja for the OOP course at Delhi Technological University.
